# The Project List
[This is a publicly visible Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13EZwEkhWfBbs5mAtR2oS2_jCj-8hzO6H/edit?pli=1#gid=1162304596) that I've been using to track my projects.  It started as a way to see whether I'm the type of person who tends to start a dozen projects or finish one, but it turns out I do a lot of both.  I'm planning to create individual blog entries about the most insteresting projects, so stay tuned!
