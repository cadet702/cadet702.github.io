Have you ever read the children's book "1000 Baseball Cards Under the Sea"?  Well, here's the one senctence summary.  The main character finds a piece of rubber on the street, takes it to his friend who use it to complete a homemade submarine and they go on an awesome adventure under the sea.  That's all well and good for the main character, but if you think about it for a minute, that's just another Tuesday for his friend.  Somehow, that story always stuck with me.  

I'm an electronics and embedded systems enthuasist.  I love making awesome and useful things from stuff that other people would call junk.  Next time you're cleaning out an electronics bin, maybe you'll consider taking something appart or giving it to someone who wants to.  Who knows, it just might end up pictured on someone's blog a few years later. ;-)

Also check out the [Griffin Instruments page](https://griffin-instruments.github.io/) where I'm documenting our work on the operant box project.

### GitHub

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the code for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/cadet702/cadet702.github.io).

My GitHub profile is [here](https://github.com/cadet702).  With the possible exception of [this Python traning challenge](https://github.com/cadet702/Display_Puzzle), my most interesting code projest live in private repos (or none at all for those special things like Excel that don't play nicely with version control).
